> **Caution Regarding Compiling a List of "Bad Actors" in Africa's Tech Space**

It's important to approach something like this with caution because compiling a list of "Bad Actors" can raise ethical and legal concerns. Before doing this, are you sure about the authenticity of this info?

- If you're even considering something like this, you should consider that sharing personal information, like names, email addresses, phone numbers, National Identity Numbers (NIN), Bank Verification Numbers (BVN), and other details without the individuals' consent can be a breach of privacy and may have legal implications, including potential violations of some data protection laws.

- Keep in mind that we have some Data Protection Laws in Nigeria as well.

I'd also suggest you show solid evidence about the details you're adding. False accusations can harm innocent individuals and damage their reputations. If you're taking matters into one's own hands and publicly accusing individuals of being "bad actors", you might be responsible for any possibility of "vigilante-like" justice. It's usually better to report suspicious activities to appropriate authorities or actual security professionals.

**This is not right!**
